# Reports
This folder contains folders generated by ```Postprocessing.report()``` function.

The generated reports are laballed by date and time (local or UTC, specified by the ```utc``` argument), and formatted as and html "website". 

Any browser should be able to open and view the ```index.html``` file.

Additionally, if ```pandoc``` is available this command:
```
pandoc -f html -t commonmark index.html > report.md
```
will generate a markdown version. Other conversions are also possible, see pandoc's documentation for that.
