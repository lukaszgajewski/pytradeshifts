# Government stability index data
This is needed for node/network stability metric.
We provide one data set:

- [World Bank governence indicator, 2022](worldbank_governence_indicator_2022_normalised.csv)

The World Bank's index is the mean of all "Estimate" values from the WGI full dataset Excel file (see data sources below). These values are normally in range [-2.5, 2.5], we normalise the data such that it's in range [0, 1].
