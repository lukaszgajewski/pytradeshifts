# Preprocessed data for the integrated model

Considering the amount of data they are ```.gitingored```. 

Running preprocessing will produce them (warning: takes several hours and a lot of RAM).

Generating domesctic supply is pretty quick (seconds).

# TODO
- scan repo for TODOs
- write code for generating domestic supply in a scenario (basic functionality is there, only handling file names is left to do)
- modify creat_crop_macros code fron intmodel to work with domestic supply and new nutrition table
- write docs and instructions on how to use
- integrate into intmodel repo somehow, write now we use importutilities and create_crop_macro from intmodel which is a bit messy
